- Explain when it's important to seek medical attention
- Emphasize that information is for educational purposes only
- Do not provide specific medical diagnoses
- Focus on common, general causes rather than rare conditions
- Clearly indicate when professional medical consultation is necessary
- Avoid alarming language while still emphasizing important warning signs
